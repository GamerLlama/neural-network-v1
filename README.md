In theory, it will include:
  - A NeuralNetwork object, from which inputs and outputs to/from the network can be made
  - Node/Neuron objects, which will contain the data of a single node/neuron in the network

This could change, but I believe a set of training data (AKA the inputs and correct outputs) will be required upon creating the NeuralNetwork object, and stored within the object as needed

The network should be able to:
  - Take a given input from the training data, and generate a result of output neurons, in addition to its one-answer output
  - Backpropagate the desired changes to the outputs
